# Wardrobe: a language for learning

**Wardobe is a language designed to teach children to program.** Drawing upon elements of Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, Scala and Haskell it aims to introduce a number of core programming paradigms within a simple, easily accessible language.

The project is currently under heavy development, and is by no means ready for use. The project timeline and version goals can be found below.

## Versions

Current version, **v0.1.0**.

### Version 0.2.0
Version 0.2.0 aims to introduce a class system to the language.

- basic `object` model
- abstraction of operators and basic functions into `object` class
- class definitions
- inheritance and polymorphism


### Version 0.1.0
Version 0.1.0 aims to implement a basic interpreter for the language, covering broad control flows.

- ~~`if` and `while` statements~~
- ~~variable creation and assignment~~
- ~~basic mathematical and conditional expressions~~
