# Wardrobe: a language for learning

**Wardobe is a language designed to teach children to program.** Drawing upon elements of Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, Scala and Haskell it aims to introduce a number of core programming paradigms within a simple, easily accessible language.

The project as a whole has three core elements to it:

1. **Syntax and semantics** which are discussed within [this](http://github.com/joeroot/wardrobe-report) report.

2. **A JavaScript interpreter** whose source code can be found [here](http://github.com/joeroot/wardrobe).

3. **A web-based environment** whose source code can be found [here](http://github.com/joeroot/wardrobe-frontend)

The project is currently under heavy development, and is by no means ready for use. The project timeline and version goals can be found below.

## Versions

Current version, **v0.0.1**.

### Version 0.1.0
Version 0.1.0 aims to implement a basic interpreter for the language, covering broad control flows, including `if`, `while` and `for` statements, variable assignment and basic types.
